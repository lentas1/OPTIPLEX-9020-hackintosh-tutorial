# Notes:
- I'm not responsible for any harm done to your PC :-) Use my experiences and EFI at your own risk, even though I think this doesn't do much harm ;-).
- Most of the things I did went according @ trs96 his outstanding guides on: 
https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/the-dell-optimac-big-sur-opencore-thread.302383/
- AMD GPU is NOT supported/tested and will fail to work without changes to the EFI.

# OpenCore
OpenCore is working very well. A small how-to here: 

PRECAUSION:
- I'm using OpenCore. You can download the latest build from here which you can use during the EFI creation as per below (or use mine...): https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases
- Also great info from: https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/extras/big-sur/#backstory

- USB preparation and installation of Big Sur/Monterey according this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J22vqnS-QZ4&t=2s
- Create your EFI:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyDJMNMFi6I&t=58s
- When the EFI is done, add your SSDT's and DTSD's to the EFI partition using OpenCoreConfigurator to mount the EFI
- After that, create your own Serial Number using OpenCoreConfigurator

# Serial number:
You need to make your own serial number, so that your iCloud etc. will work without using someone else his serial number. In OC GEN-X or in OpenCore Configurator you can generate a new one if you don't have one yet, or if you need a new one.

# Updating Hackintosh (MacOS)
- In general; watch others do first to see if they succeed 
- Make sure first to install the latest Kext files
- Install latest OpenCore; but first make sure that this works according other users. Latest OpenCore build:
https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases

# Kexts:
Make sure (!) you are using the latest kexts: 

- AppleALC.kext
https://github.com/acidanthera/applealc/releases
- IntelMausi.kext
https://github.com/acidanthera/IntelMausi/releases
- SMCProcessor.kext
It's part of the VirtualSMC zip as per below kext
- USBInjectAll.kext
https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-usb-inject-all/downloads/
- Lilu.kext
https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases
- WhateverGreen.kext
https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/releases
- VirtualSMC.kext
https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/releases

For convenvience purposes, use either OpenCore Configurator or Hackintool to mount EFI and update the Kexts. I always provide the latest Kexts in my EFI as per below.

# Update your OpenCore EFI (small how-to)

 # Option 1 (easy): Update using HackinDROM 
 Download the app here:
 https://hackindrom.zapto.org 
 
 and watch a how-to here:

 # Option 2 (time consuming): Manually
https://github.com/joostiphone/Update-OpenCore-to-latest-version

# Latest Changes on uploaded EFI (without a Serial Number):
Please note that I only use the latest Stable released versions of MacOS and OpenCore (so no beta's, nighly builds or latest commitments).
